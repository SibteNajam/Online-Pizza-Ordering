Router v6.4+, it introduced data loaders for data fetching tied to routes.
Loaders provide an easy way to fetch data before rendering the route components.
Fetch-on-navigation, meaning the data is fetched when the user navigates to a new route.
Simple for route-driven components where data is mostly static or fetched once per navigation.


RTK Query is better suited for:

Complex applications where state is shared across multiple components.
Scenarios where caching, invalidation, or background data synchronization (e.g., polling) is needed.
If you're already using Redux for state management, RTK Query fits seamlessly.
React Router (with loaders) is better suited for:

Simpler applications where data is primarily tied to route changes and doesnâ€™t need to be globally available.
If you prefer to avoid setting up Redux and want data to be fetched specifically when navigating to a new route.

If you need global state management, caching, and fine control over your API requests, go with RTK Query.
If your data is tightly coupled with routes and navigation, and your app is simpler, then React Router loaders might be the better choice.
